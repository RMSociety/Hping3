introduction....
hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn’t only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a covered channel, and many other features.
Instructions:
# git clone https://github.com/HiddenShot/Hping3.git
# cd Hping3
# python3 hping.py
